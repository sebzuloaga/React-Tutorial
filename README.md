# React-Tutorial Part 1: Introduction to JSX & React

In this tutorial you will learn how to get started with React JS. React is a framework that allows us to create websites that are built on the basis of reusable components. Traditional websites are built on the basis of adding all of the code to be rendered onto the single file. However React JS will separate your code onto different components and thus different files. 

There are many advantages to React JS, but here are a couple of them:

1. Components are reusable 
2. Components are easy to maintain than traditional static websites
3. React JS allows for better performance based on rendering chamnges only when necessary
4. It can lead you on to React Native development
